# hello-world
it says hello world and maybe other stuff
i have changed the document, for some reason it still doesnt say hello world, what sort of "techer has you make a hello world document without actualy making it say hello world, they would need to be some sort of lunatic deliberatly trying to make people hate education, this tyrant surely must be able to see their own evil 
ps fuck the creator of this module
